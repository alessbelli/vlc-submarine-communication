This is a project to build an end-to-end communication protocol, implemented between two arduinos, to use a very simple hardware setup to request data to be uploaded from the emitter side, and then to receive it using a blue diode and a visible-light photodiode. The purpose of this would be to have an underwater, battery-powered device that can log data from different sensors. Then, an ROV from a nearby boat could periodically approach the fixed device and instruct it to upload the data, and to empty its memory.
